# Cursor Designs Collection

This directory contains **approved cursor designs** that have been tested and refined for the React Component Cursor showcase application.

## Purpose

- **Quality Control**: Only cursor designs that meet our standards are moved here
- **Reusability**: Clean, standalone cursor components that can be imported anywhere
- **Organization**: Centralized location for all approved cursor designs
- **Documentation**: Each cursor design is well-documented with features and usage

## Current Designs

### OrganicCloudCursor
**File**: `organic-cloud-cursor.tsx`  
**Features**:
- Particle-based organic cloud effect with 12 main particles
- Additional smaller particles for depth
- Smooth animations with randomized movement patterns
- Subtle outer particles with ping animation
- Purple/pink color scheme with organic shapes

**Usage**:
```tsx
import { OrganicCloudCursor } from '../cursor-designs';

<CustomCursor>
  <OrganicCloudCursor />
</CustomCursor>
```

## Adding New Designs

When a cursor design is approved:

1. **Extract** the cursor component to a new file in this directory
2. **Document** the features and usage in this README
3. **Export** the component in `index.ts`
4. **Update** the original implementation to import from here
5. **Test** to ensure it works correctly

## Guidelines

- Each cursor should be a **standalone component**
- Include comprehensive **TypeScript types**
- Use **descriptive names** that reflect the visual design
- Add **JSDoc comments** explaining features and behavior
- Ensure **performance optimization** with React.memo, useMemo, etc.
- Test on **different screen sizes** and devices
