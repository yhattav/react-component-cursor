# MDC File Handling Best Practices

## Critical Tool Limitations
- **NEVER use `read_file` tool for .mdc frontmatter verification** - it skips/hides YAML frontmatter sections
- **AVOID `edit_file` tool for frontmatter changes** - it can strip or corrupt YAML frontmatter
- **ALWAYS verify .mdc frontmatter** with terminal commands before and after edits

## Recommended Tools for .mdc Files

### ✅ SAFE for Reading Frontmatter
- `run_terminal_cmd` with `head -10 file.mdc` (shows first 10 lines including frontmatter)
- `run_terminal_cmd` with `cat file.mdc` (shows entire file)
- `run_terminal_cmd` with `grep -A5 -B5 "^---" file.mdc` (shows frontmatter sections)

### ✅ SAFE for Editing Frontmatter
- `run_terminal_cmd` with `sed`, `awk`, or `printf` commands
- Manual editing by user (most reliable)
- `run_terminal_cmd` with `echo` and redirection for simple changes

### ⚠️ LIMITED SAFE Usage
- `edit_file` tool - ONLY for content below frontmatter (after the second `---` line)
- Always verify frontmatter preservation after using `edit_file`

## Standard Verification Workflow

### Before Making Changes
```bash
head -10 file.mdc  # Verify current frontmatter
```

### After Making Changes  
```bash
head -10 file.mdc  # Confirm frontmatter is intact
```

### Checking All Rule Files
```bash
for file in .cursor/rules/*/*.mdc; do echo "=== $file ==="; head -6 "$file"; echo; done
```

## Project Rule Types
- **Always rules**: `alwaysApply: false` (every chat)
- **Auto rules**: `globs: "**/*.mdc" "pattern"` + `alwaysApply: false` (file matching)
- **Agent rules**: `description: "" "text"` + `alwaysApply: false` (AI decides)
- **Manual rules**: no special config (explicit reference only)

## Examples

<example>
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT: Verify frontmatter before editing
head -10 .cursor/rules/core-rules/response-constraints-always.mdc

# ✅ CORRECT: Edit frontmatter safely with terminal
sed -i '' 's/alwaysApply: false/alwaysApply: true/' file.mdc

# ✅ CORRECT: Verify changes were applied
head -10 .cursor/rules/core-rules/response-constraints-always.mdc
```
</example>

<example type="invalid">
```bash
# ❌ WRONG: Using read_file for frontmatter verification
read_file("file.mdc", lines 1-6)  # Will miss frontmatter!

# ❌ WRONG: Using edit_file for frontmatter changes  
edit_file("file.mdc", "change alwaysApply to true")  # May strip frontmatter!

# ❌ WRONG: Not verifying after changes
# Making changes without checking the result
```
</example>
